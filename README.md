# multimodal-experiment

This is a a multi-modal search application prototype build with Gradio.

In this experiment, we are using OpenAI CLIP (https://github.com/openai/CLIP). This prototype allows you query images based on similar text or simillar images.

I also included a dockerfile as well for to build a docker container for the web prototype.

To run the application, use ```gradio app.py``` in terminal
